# jsconf_br_2014_clone
This site is a personal exercise in HTML &amp; CSS. It is a duplicate of [2014.jsconfbr.org](http://2014.jsconfbr.org/).
It was an exercise during [Launch School](https://launchschool.com/) in making pixel perfect websites. The source code of the original website was never viewed during the construction of this site.

The project features pixel perfect replication, minimal use of #id and .class styling, and media queries to mimic those on original site.
